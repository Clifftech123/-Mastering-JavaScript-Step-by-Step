## JavaScript from Beginner to Master Tutorial Series

This repository contains all the code for the `JavaScript from Beginner to Master Tutorial Series`  blog series on dev.to. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning JavaScript, covering various topics in a progressive manner.

## Usage

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific blog post. Inside each folder, you will find the code examples related to that particular post.

## Running the Code

To run the code examples, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once Node.js is installed, you can execute the code by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code file is located.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
node <file-name>.js
```

Note: Make sure you have Nodemon installed globally on your machine for automatic code reloading during development. If you don't have it, you can install it by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
